# Electric_Vehicle_Data_Analysis
Electric Vehicle Data Analysis is my personal project to demonstrate my data cleaning and visualization skills
I have used skills that I have learned from classes and work expereince in this project

This data shows the Battery Electric Vheicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles that were registered under Washington State



## Conclusion

These graphs show various ways I interpreted the large dataset. 

With a histogram, I displayed distrubution of various car models in the dataset. Clearly, there are many iterations of Makes and Models!

In the pie chart, we see the top 15 most registered cars in the most purchased zip code(98052). 4 out of the top 5 cars are Teslas, compising of 68% of the total electric cars in the dataset!

In the Sankey Distrubution, we can see a quantativive visual representation of each car brand's model.
